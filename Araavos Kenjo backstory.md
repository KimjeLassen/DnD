# Introduction

Ever since I was young, I have known that I am of a different kind. Though I look human, and my parents are human, I have divine magic blood coursing through my veins. My forefathers must have been of celestial nature, they must have lain with humans, but through the many generations, that blood has thinned to the point where their magic do not appear in their genetic makeup. 

However, I am the exception. The brothers and sisters I have and have had are seemingly not born of magic as I am. Thus I have come to the conclusion that I must have been chosen by the Gods, aasimar of race, human in appearance, with the divine soul of the sorcerer people. Because of my own heritage, I have always had a certain interest in anything magical, and how it manifests within our biology; I am magical because my celestial ancestors laid with mortals, but why did I receive magical blood, when my nearest family did not? What part of me is special? These are just a few of the questions that have kept me up many nights in my life and I do believe that I have found the answers, after just thirty five years of living.

In this text, I will expound on my life, thus far, and how I found answers to my burning questions. 

# Chapter 1

My early life was nothing special, though I knew early in life that I was naturally born with magic flowing in me. The family I grew up in was one of modest living, not rich nor poor, but enough to send me to the Kings University of PLACENAME when I became old enough. Though, the parents I had could only afford it because none of the brothers of the family pursued a life of studying. As soon as my curriculum started at PLACENAME UNIVERSITY I found a job as a librarian in the university's library and ensured that I could provide for myself, after which I cut off all family connections I had and never spoke a word to any of them again. I wonder if they even know that I am alive to this day.
